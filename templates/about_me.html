        I grew up in upstate New York and graduated from Union College with a degree in Neuroscience.
        I am now a software engineer and have completed Springboard, a full-stack coding bootcamp.<br><br>
        
        I'm passionate about constantly improving my skill set and have developed regimented study habits to continue to grow.
        Iâ€™m searching for opportunities that will challenge me to always perform at a high level and continually build on my
        strong foundation.<br><br>
        
        I just finished a cross country road trip with my girlfriend and puppy and we now live in beautiful San Diego. I'd love to hear from you!</h5>
